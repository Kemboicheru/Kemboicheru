Hi, my name is Kemboi Cheruiyot (@kemboicheru) a full stack developer majorly on open source technologies with interests in contributing to open source software.
I am open to new technologies and passionate about learning and moreso serving in teams.
I currently do projects in python, php, VueJs and maintaining solutions in different technologies.

Anyway, to be sincere, I don't know how to talk about myself!
